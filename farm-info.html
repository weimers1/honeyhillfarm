						town of Livonia, New York. Our farm is dedicated to
						producing the highest quality beef through sustainable
						and ethical farming practices. We believe in treating
						our animals with the utmost care and providing them with
						a natural and stress-free environment. We are pleased to
						provide a tour of our entire operation (and a hayride!)
						to introduce people to the way all cattle should be
						raised!

		<section class="container my-5">
			<h2>Our Farming Practices</h2>
			<p>
				At HoneyHill Farm, we employ a variety of sustainable farming
				techniques to ensure the health and well-being of our cattle.
				Some of our key practices include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Managed-Grazing Method:</strong> We rotate our
					cattle through different pastures and move our cattle three
					times per day to prevent overgrazing and promote soil
					health. Our managed-grazing ensures pastures rebound
					quickly, mimicking the natural grazing patterns of North
					American bison.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Organic Feed:</strong> Our cattle are fed a diet of
					100% organic, non-GMO grasses. We raise championship Black
					Angus Beef Cattle with superior genetics sourced from the
					WYE Plantation for 100% grass-fed Angus.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Natural Water Sources:</strong> We provide our
					cattle with access to fresh, clean water from natural
					springs on our property.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Natural Weed Management:</strong> By understanding
					the life cycle of weeds, we manage them naturally without
					poisons or herbicides.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>No Chemicals Ever:</strong> We never use any
					antibiotics on our cattle as we ensure they are always
					healthy and protected. We have never applied any herbicides,
					pesticides, or artificial substances to our land since 1978.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Dung Beetle Integration:</strong>
					We use no substances that would harm beneficial insects like
					dung beetles, allowing them to thrive. Dung beetles on our
					farm quickly remove manure underground, reducing pests and
					naturally fertilizing our pastures.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Minimal Motorized Equipment:</strong> The only
					motorized equipment used on our farm is a tractor with a
					mower, promoting a natural environment.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Clean and Safe Environment:</strong> Our farm is
					clean, neat, and orderly, ensuring that food is raised in a
					safe environment.
				</li>
				<li class="pb-3">
					<strong>Dry-Aged Beef:</strong> All of our beef is dry-aged
					for two full weeks, then cut and vacuum sealed by our
					professional butcher.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Grass-Fed Beef Section -->
		<section class="container my-5">
			<h2>Grass-Fed Beef</h2>
			<p>
				Our beef is 100% grass-fed and grass-finished, which means our
				cattle graze on our lush, green pastures for the entire season.
				This method not only provides our animals with a natural diet
				but also results in beef that is higher in healthy fats,
				vitamins, and minerals. Grass-fed beef is known for its rich
				flavor and superior nutritional profile.
			</p>
		</section>

		<!-- Quality Assurance Section -->
		<section class="container my-5">
			<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
			<p>
				We are committed to producing beef of the highest quality. Our
				farming practices are designed to maintain the health and
				well-being of our cattle, which translates into better quality
				meat for you. Our commitment to quality is backed by
				<a
					href="documents/cornell_report_vinegar.pdf"
					target="_blank"
					class="text-decoration-none"
					>studies conducted by Cornell University</a
				>, which have consistently shown the superiority of our beef.
